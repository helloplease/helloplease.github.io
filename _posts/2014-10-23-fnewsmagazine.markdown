        	"F" is a student-run journal of art criticism, culture, and politics from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. It's released monthly during the school year. It was also, the first time Chris, Magda & Freddy worked together. During our time at F Newsmagazine, the staff was honored with awards from the Student Society for News Design's 26th annual College News Design Contest including: Best Redesign of a Magazine, Best Overall Design of a Magazine, Best Overall Design of a Special Section and both 1st and 2nd place for cover design.
