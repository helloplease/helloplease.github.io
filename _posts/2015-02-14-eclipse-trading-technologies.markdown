    <h3><strong>eclipse trading technologies</strong></h3>
        <p>
        	Eclipse Trading Technologies is a young trading firm in Chicago, compromised of tight-knit team of technically advanced traders. Eclipse believes that as a small, forward-thinking, and agile company, with their experience, and technical savvy, they can out perform larger and firms who are mired in the past. They also like to play ping-pong at the office.
            helloplease worked with Eclipse to establish their identity within these strong traits. Eclipse's identity should stand out from the crowd, and look different than the "usual suspects."
