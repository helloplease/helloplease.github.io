        Norton's exhibition acts in relation to the museum's historical conceit, itself an architectural homage to Mies van der Rohe and the impact of modernist style on the Illinois landscape. The booklet was created as a companion to the show, part journal and part field guide——it outlines the conceptual and physical experience of the space, complete with found imagery, artistic documentation, and maps.
